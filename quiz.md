1. What kind of signal is used in speech recognition?
   - [ ] Electromagnetic signal
   - [ ] Electric signal
   - [ ] Acoustic signal
   - [ ] Radar

2. What is called as the properties of the signal that extend over interval?
   - [ ]  Hops
   - [ ]  Rate
   - [ ]  Frames
   - [ ]  Analog signal

3. What are periodic changes in pressure that propagate through the air?
   - [ ] Air waves
   - [ ] Sound waves
   - [ ] Rate
   - [ ] None of above

4. Which of the following is a benefit of AI-enhanced speech recognition?
   - [ ] Recall of information using voice print
   - [ ] No need for live agents
   - [ ] Analysis of conversation for emotional markers
   - [ ] Predictive answers to anticipated questions

5. The process of identifying  words that can recognize words spoken spontaneously without time lag between words is called..
   - [ ] Isolated words
   - [ ] Continous speech
   - [ ] Complex words
   - [ ] Spontaneous speech

6. The basic idea of speech recognition is to simulate the formulation of human communication through a speech. Formulation of communication can be explained as the following steps:
   1. Sound is transmitted through acoustic waves in the air to the listener's ears as vibrations
   2. The vibrations are converted into "language" in the listener's brain
   3. The speaker produces sound from the vocal cords and speech system
   4. The brain understands / extracts the meaning of the sound
   5. The speaker formulates his words in a word
   6. Sound is transmitted to the listener's brain through the auditory nerve

   The correct sequence of communication formulations is...
   - [ ] 5,3,1,2,6,4
   - [ ] 5,3,1,6,4,2
   - [ ] 5,3,1,6,2,4
   - [ ] 5,3,1,4,2,6

7. Consider the following code below!
   ```
    def speech_out(text):
      tts = gTTS(text, lang='id')
      tts.save('audio.mp3')
      os.system("mpg123 audio.mp3")
   ```
   Which the following statement is false about code above?

   - [ ] we define a function to speech out a text input
   - [ ] input text will be saved on file audio.mp3
   - [ ] input text will be saved on file mpg123
   - [ ] we use Indonesian language to speech out the text
